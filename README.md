I am a self-employed (web-) developer based in Graz (Austria) with a love for minimalist UIs.


- ðŸ”­ I'm currently mostly working with Typescript, React and Vite.
- ðŸŒ± In my spare time I'm currently learning Lua, Rust and Vue.
- ðŸŽˆ Occasionally, I get a little too obsessed with coffee, mechanical keyboards and NeoVim.
